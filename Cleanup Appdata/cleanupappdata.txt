Note that this module reviews all of your previously installed Docker Containers to determine which appdata folders are abandoned. If you deleted the previously installed list (either through Community Applications or manually), those results will not be displayed. In other words, if there is no record for a folder within the previously installed Containers, you will not be prompted to delete it.
